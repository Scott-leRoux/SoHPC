# Coulomb Matrix 

This folder contains files from using Coulomb Matrix for feature engineering and model Tuning. 

run files in order 

python3 cm_qm9_data.py <data>
python3 cm_tune.py 

the hyperparamters tuned are: Learning rate, Network Topology and activation Function. 

Coulomb matrix is the smallest and simplest descriptor in Dscribe and works the best for predicting internal energy on the QM9 dataset.
